# AI-Voice-Assisted-Using-ChatGPT-API
This project involves building a real-time AI-powered voice assistant that leverages the capabilities of the ChatGPT API to understand natural language, process user queries, and respond intelligently using text-to-speech (TTS). The assistant can interact via voice input and output, enabling hands-free, conversational experiences.
