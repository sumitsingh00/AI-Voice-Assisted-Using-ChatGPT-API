# AI-Voice-Assisted-Using-ChatGPT-API
This project involves building a real-time AI-powered voice assistant that leverages the capabilities of the ChatGPT API to understand natural language, process user queries, and respond intelligently using text-to-speech (TTS). The assistant can interact via voice input and output, enabling hands-free, conversational experiences.
✨ Key Features:
🎙️ Voice Recognition: Captures user input through speech using tools like Google Speech Recognition API or Whisper.

🧠 Natural Language Processing: Sends transcribed text to OpenAI’s ChatGPT API for intelligent response generation.

🔁 Context-Aware Conversations: Maintains conversational memory for back-and-forth, human-like dialogue.

🔊 Voice Response: Converts ChatGPT’s text output to speech using gTTS, pyttsx3, or Amazon Polly.

⚙️ Command Execution (Optional): Perform tasks like opening apps, fetching weather, setting reminders, etc.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Frontend/UI: Python (Tkinter, PyQt) or web-based (React/HTML)

Backend: Python

APIs/Services:

ChatGPT API (OpenAI)

Speech Recognition (Google/Whisper)

Text-to-Speech (gTTS, pyttsx3)

Libraries: speech_recognition, openai, pyttsx3, gtts, flask (for REST API, if needed)
